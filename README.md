MemeChat is a real-time, anonymous chat web application that connects users randomly for one-on-one conversations. Inspired by platforms like WhatsApp and Omegle, MemeChat allows users to exchange text messages, images, and emojis in a modern, responsive interface. Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and Socket.IO, the application ensures smooth and instant communication without requiring user accounts or personal data. Key features include a WhatsApp-style chat UI, typing indicators, emoji picker, image sharing, and a floating scroll-to-bottom button that enhances user experience. MemeChat is designed to be fast, private, and accessible across devices, making it ideal for casual chatting and real-time interaction demos.
